# wt-webradio An Phantom Voices
A project for Werkplaats Typografie in Arnhem.

## About

I've decided to build this project in PHP because it would be easier given the menu structure.
If you like to change the session date, for now, you can go to script.js and change the countdown date in the variable.

### week of Feb 10 2020

I've decided to make everything as static as possible. As this is a temporarily maintained project. No need to put too much fancy php work in it. Tabea Nixdorff and Hannah Sakai shall provide me with content and I shall implement it throughout the site.

### Structure of this site
There's a page per month. A month needs to have an active class in the corresponding month and a p5 js file. The content container holds a left and a right side.

## Sources
The base template for this is based off my [blank static template](https://github.com/BluePraise/blank-static-html)

We've used [P5.js](https://p5js.org/) from [Lauren Lee McCarthy](https://lauren-mccarthy.com/Info)
