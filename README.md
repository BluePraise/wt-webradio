# wt-webradio An Phantom Voices
A project for Werkplaats Typografie in Arnhem.

## About

I've decided to build this project in PHP because it would be easier given the menu structure.
If you like to change the session date, for now, you can go to script.js and change the countdown date in the variable.

## Sources
The base template for this is based off my [blank static template](https://github.com/BluePraise/blank-static-html)

We've used [P5.js](https://p5js.org/) from [Lauren Lee McCarthy](https://lauren-mccarthy.com/Info)
