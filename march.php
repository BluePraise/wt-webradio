                <p>Sonic Meditation meetings are inspired by Pauline Oliveros, who introduced them as non-verbal group work, as a way of attuning yourself to others, through one's own voice as well as exercising to listen to each other without the pressure of daily speech, often being marked by gendered parameters</p>

Actresses were forbidden from the stage; all roles were played by men. Thus, femininity being marked by makeup, wigs, costumes and gestures. Visual representation compensated the absence of her voice.  The mirrors host a reflection of her voice into current space (music by Koppi Mizrahi).</p>
